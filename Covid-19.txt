A. A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID -19 virus is inconclusive.  
a. Incon clusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratory.  
OR  
B. A suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason.

Definition of contact  
A contact is a person who experienced any one  of the following exposures during the 2 days before and the 14 days 
after the onset of symptoms of a probable or confirmed case:

Definition of COVID -19 death
