age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch

It was the season of Light, it was the season of Dar kness, it 
was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair . 
There ain't no gold in this rive r, that I've been washin' my 
hands in forever . I know there is hope in these waters , but I 
can't bring myself to swim , when I am drowning in this 
silence . Baby, let me in . 
Go easy on me, baby , I was  still a child , didn't get the chance 
to. Feel the world around me , I had no time to choose . What I 
chose to do , so go easy on me .  
There ain't no room for things to change . When we are both so 
deeply stuck in our ways , you can't deny how hard I have 
tried , I change d who I was to put you both first , but now I 
give up .

I had good intentions , and the highest hopes . 
But I know r ight now . That probably doesn't even show . Go 
easy on me, baby . I was still a child , I didn't get the chance to , 
feel the world around me . I had no time to choose , what I 
chose to do . So go easy on me .
